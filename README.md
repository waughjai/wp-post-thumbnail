WP Post Thumbnail
=========================

Simple class for getting WordPress thumbnail.

# How to Use

Create a WPPostThumbnail instance by passing the constructor a post ID. Then, call that instance's getHTML method to generate its responsive picture HTML.

Pass an array of attributes as the constructor's 2nd argument to customize the HTML.

# Error Handling

Error Handling works just as for its parent class, HTMLPicture. See that class’s documentation for mo’ information.
